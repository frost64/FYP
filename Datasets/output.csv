1 I noticed it overheats especially if you play games 
2 minimal settings options not very in depth cant alter much on it  
3 battery is pretty bad on it it dies pretty quickly and if it goes completely dead I worry it will not turn on again that being said I have let it go dead but it has come on I just had to leave it on charge nearly a day before I could turn it on  
4 often crashes but that's probably down to android OS being poorly optimised for this tablet 
5 files are difficult to find within the system unless you jump through several hoops  
6 very sturdy though takes a beating and still holds together  
7 size of screen is good and clear quality of picture  
8 charging jack is prone to shifting ",31 Dec 2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,Corning Gorilla Glass 4  oleophobic coating,,,,,

It is slugish  unstable and no software updates from acer. 
If jellybean was avalable or at least a custom jellybean rom the phone would have been usable if you dont load alot of aps or try anything that will need prossesing power  the phone prosseses data about as fast as a human would with a pen and paper.  
I bought this phone as a non permanent device becuse my phone was stolen  the first month was tolarable with lag here and there and the phone takeing his time on some tasks  after that it was a sharp decline downhill  it sometimes takes 3min just to open a text and even longer to find a contact on my list  randon complete crashes and apps not responding is a every day incounter. Sometimes the keyboard randomly refuses to accept any input and a reboot is needed  I tryed to fix this by using a 3rd party keyboard with no luck. When I recive a phone call the call dont show up for me to answer untuil 3seconds after it starts to ring and once I swype to answer another 2 to 4 seconds of lag. 
I dont whish this much frustration to my worst enemy  this phone is a do t buy in every category. 
web browsing is a nightmare  zoom and scroll on page is more than just slugish  and pages take an eternety to load even on fast networks and wifi. Then just as you FINALY got to the page you wanted the browser will crash and not remember were you were. This brings me to wifi  verry poor wifi connection and takes most of the phones resources wich makes it inpossable to preform evetyday tasks like texting or checking the weather. The GPS is virtualy non existant  its worse than those first gps phones in the 2000s  most of the time it will rely on the cell towers to triqngulate you to about 5km and when the gps actualy trys to pin you it is not only within a 500m range but sometimes way of. Even everyday tasks is to much for it  like typing  it lags incredebly sometimes  most of the time the letters show up 2 or 3 seconds after I touched it and sometimes like I said never do.
 
Closing statement  If you are planning on using  ot for more than a month this is the worst phone you can get. It hase brought shame on the Android name and ensured that I never spend money on ACER again",21 Apr 2014,HSDPA 900 / 2100 ,,HSPA,PowerVR SGX531,LED flash,,MP3/WAV/WMA/eAAC+ player  MP4/H.264 player  Organizer  Document viewer  Voice memo/dial  Predictive text input,,,,,,,,,,,

The problemen with this phone is that the ram is full when you the slightest thing on it. And dare to install messenger and you can forget it  continiously freezing or lagging or just dont starting up the apps you want to. But when you start up and you have (almost) empty ram  you can run some suprisingly large apps  like wot blitz  but not very long because the battery isnt up to the job and gets hot very quickly. Also at low battery i have found the phone to run significantly slower. That probablt is because the most beautiful screen i have ever seen  with a ridiculous amount of pixel density.
